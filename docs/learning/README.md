Welcome to the BlockCore learning journey! This section is designed for developers transitioning from enterprise development to game engine development.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By the end of this learning path, you'll understand:
- How game engines differ from enterprise applications
- Graphics programming fundamentals
- Real-time systems architecture
- Performance optimization for games
- Voxel-based rendering techniques

## ðŸ“š Learning Structure

### Prerequisites
- [Overview](prerequisites/overview.md) - What you need to know before starting
- [Key Concepts](prerequisites/concepts.md) - Game development fundamentals
- [Tools & Setup](prerequisites/tools-setup.md) - Development environment

### Version-Based Learning
- [v0.1 Learning Guide](v0.1/what-you-will-learn.md) - Foundation concepts
- [v0.2 Learning Guide](v0.2/what-you-will-learn.md) - World generation *(Planned)*
- [v0.3 Learning Guide](v0.3/what-you-will-learn.md) - Physics systems *(Planned)*

### Reference Materials
- [Glossary](reference/glossary.md) - Game development terminology
- [Common Patterns](reference/common-patterns.md) - Engine architecture patterns
- [Troubleshooting](reference/troubleshooting.md) - Common issues and solutions

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

If you're new to game development, start with:
1. [Prerequisites Overview](prerequisites/overview.md)
2. [v0.1 Learning Guide](v0.1/what-you-will-learn.md)
3. Follow the step-by-step implementation

## ðŸ’¡ Enterprise Developer Notes

Coming from enterprise development? Here are key differences:
- **Real-time vs Request-Response**: Games run at 60+ FPS continuously
- **Performance Critical**: Every millisecond matters
- **Graphics APIs**: Different from web/desktop APIs
- **Memory Management**: More manual control needed
- **State Management**: Game state vs business state
