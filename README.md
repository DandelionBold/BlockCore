**A modular, open-source voxel game engine powering sandbox worlds.**

BlockCore is a high-performance game engine built with C# and .NET 9, designed specifically for voxel-based games. It provides the foundational systems for rendering, physics, world generation, networking, plugins, and resource management‚Äîeverything needed to build immersive sandbox experiences like [MineWorld](https://github.com/DandelionBold/MineWorld).

## üéØ Features

- **üé® High-Performance Rendering**: Modern graphics pipeline with greedy meshing, shader support, and optimized chunk rendering
- **üåç Infinite Procedural Worlds**: Deterministic world generation from seeds with configurable biomes and structures
- **‚ö° Physics Engine**: AABB collision detection, character controller, and voxel-based physics
- **üîå Plugin System**: Sandboxed Lua/JS plugin host with versioned APIs and capability checks
- **üì¶ Resource Packs**: VFS-based pack system supporting textures, models, shaders, and localization
- **üåê Networking**: Client-server architecture with chunk streaming and authoritative server
- **üíæ Save System**: Compressed region files with atomic writes and version migration
- **‚öôÔ∏è Configuration**: TOML/JSON-based config with hot-reload support
